> add second enemy type that resets player on touch
> add main menue
> do something reasonable after completing all levels instead of just freezing
> make more backgrounds and load them from the JSON level-files
> better actor sprites
> make a level editor
> add lighting
> add sounds
> add music

> add network support
> add text overlays that tell story
> add cutscenes of some sort (like images with scrolling paralax stuff and text b4 levels or sth)

done:
> add walls that raise/lower
> load raise/lower walls from file (and delete them on new-lvl)
> add switches that move/delete/add walls
> add second player
> let watchers/goal/triggers interact with 2nd player
> put wall between player1 and 2 in new level
> allow wall extension along y axis in lvl-json
> load pressure plates from level.json
> Keep lines showing after loading new level
> add walls that appear when a player stands on a switch
    >> make them spawn/remove multiple walls; create mazes where one player controls the switches and the other has to move through


Story Idea:
> one player gets "regular" intro
> other player is told to do specific things / make player1 do specific things for points
> other player secretly opposes player1 some way somehow
